TO RUN MISMIP+ MPM-SSA-damage tests


 Tests are in the following subdirectories:

 ./steady:
 -run a steady state MISMIP+ SSA simulation using sMPM/GIMPM
  as in Part I of Huth et al., 2020

 ./damage:
 -run MISMIP+ SSA simulations with a damage model, using
  sMPM/GIMPM as in Part II of Huth et al., 2020. Included
  damage models:

    -Nonlocal creep damage (Huth et al., 2020, Part II):
     	       mismip_creep.sif
    -Zero-stress damage (i.e. Sun et al., 2017):
    	       mismip_zs.sif
    -Zero-stress damage (using Bassis and Ma, 2015 mod):
    	       mismip_zs_mod.sif
