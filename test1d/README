1-D sMPM and GIMPM tests from Huth et al., 2021 Part I.

./frontprop1d contains the front propagation test
./steady1d contains the steady 1-D test

1. compile the user functions
elmerf90 USF_1dtest.F90 -o USF_1dtest

2. make the grids, e.g.
ElmerGrid 1 2 Test1D_5km.grd -autoclean

Both ./frontprop1d and ./steady1d contain a RUN.sh file,
where the mesh, grid resolution, initial number of
particle per grid cell, use of the particle reweighting scheme,
and MPM shape functions can be specified. Modify this file
accordingly and begin the simulations (source RUN.sh).
